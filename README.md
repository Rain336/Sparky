# Sparky

Sparky is an MVU base Flutter inspired Mobile UI Framework for C#

Sparky uses SkiaSharp for drawing, but isn't opinionated about any style.
Sparky only ships with the minimum components needed, so custom UI styles can be made.
A Material Design UI Library for Sparky might be created in the future though.

Currently only a Vulkan Renderer and a fallback OpenGL Renderer are implemented for Android, but a Metal Renderer for iOS is planned.

Interaction and Layouting isn't implemented yet, but plans are made.
